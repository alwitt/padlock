# User authentication submodule configuration
#
# The authentication submodule accepts verification requests from HTTP proxies to determine
# whether a user can be authenticated.
#
# The submodule authenticates a user via OpenID token validation (the OpenID provider
# configuration is supplied through a separate file), where the token is presented as a
# bearer authorization token.
#
# Upon successful token validation, the submodule will add these additional headers to the
# response. Always present:
#   * User's user ID with the OpenID provider: store as authorize.requestParamHeaders.userID
#
# if available:
#   * User's OpenID username: store as authorize.requestParamHeaders.username
#   * User's first name: store as authorize.requestParamHeaders.firstName
#   * User's last name: store as authorize.requestParamHeaders.lastName
#   * User's email: store as authorize.requestParamHeaders.email
#
# These values are extracted from the token directly, so the user will need to indicate which
# token claims provide which piece of information on the user.
#
# NOTE: the example given here are based on tokens generated by KeyCloak.
